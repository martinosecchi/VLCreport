% here, stuff about what the project is about, so the robotics part
% only short digression on vlc, more in the related work section, together with other technologies too
% here goes the robotics stuff, motivation basically, what are the main goals i want to achieve, what will happen in the rest of the thesis


% Intro on vlc
Visible Light Communication, often abbreviated to VLC, is a type of wireless communication achieved with the transmission of signals in the spectrum of visible light.
For most applications, this communication form is implemented through the use of  normal light emitting diodes (LEDs) or fluorescent lamps switched on and off at high rates to produce light signals.
It is gaining increasing popularity as an application of pervasive computing, since many light emitting devices are commonly present in everyday life and used everywhere.

% situated
This form of communication, compared to more classic ones, could potentially be beneficial in the context of mobile robotics among others, for the reason that light is a form of \textbf{situated} communication, where the message is not separated from the physical environment in which it has meaning.\\
This allows to transmit a message that includes additional information embedded in the medium of transmission rather than its content.
Particularly relevant for mobile robotics is the information relative to localisation and direction, that can just be seen as the source of the light instead of it being encoded in the message.
In this way, the content of the message and the properties of the transmission combined together produce the information to be received. \\
%applications
Such a technology could be used in it simplest form in the context of mobile robotics to provide an aid for environment navigation, or a form of remote control for agents' movement or for assistance in the execution of specific tasks. 
These are a few examples of mono directional, environment-to-robot communication systems.
The technology could also be used in a slightly more complex scenario of robot-to-robot 1- or even 2-way communication between multiple agents to enable cooperation.
%design
The design of a prototype system will help analyse the properties of a generic VLC system, its performances and results in the given applicative scenario.
The design process will be focused on simplicity and inexpensiveness where possible, by using mostly off-the-shelf and easily obtainable components.\\

%lifi and optical
In recent years optical communication has seen a great spread mostly thanks to optical fibre.
As opposed to optical fibre communication, VLC is meant to be propagated wirelessly over free space.
By modulating a light source, like could be a common LED bulb, through a controller it is possible to encode messages from digital form into light signals.
The simplest example of this encoding is a binary representation of data through light, where the presence of light represents a binary 1 and its absence a 0.
This form of communication is a simplified variation of the technology known as Li-Fi, a term that stands for Light-Fidelity.
